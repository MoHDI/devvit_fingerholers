and bind a resizer listener and repositon everything
this.scale.on('resize', this.resize, this)

    resize() {
        this.score.setPosition(this.scale.width / 2, 12)
        if (!this.isGameStarted) {
            this.player.setPosition(200, this.scale.height / 2 - 100)
            this.intro.setPosition(this.player.x + 100, this.player.y + 100)
            this.introText.setPosition(this.player.x, this.player.y + 75)
        }
    }
`
smth like this

coding is like magic that I can do but I'm not totally sure how magic works

It is important to remove that listener then you switch scenes so you wont have multiple resize listeners on the same scene
E.g.
globalEventEmitter.once(
            'gameOver',
            (data: { isNewHighscore: boolean; newScore: number; highscore: number; attempts: number }) => {
                this.scale.off('resize', this.resize, this)
                this.scene.run('GameOver', data)
            }
        )
